<u>bored11/06/25</u>
boredom is the worst but also kinda the only thing that makes u think sometimes. most of the time u just wanna scroll or watch videos or play some dumb game to not feel it. it is like this itch u cant scratch and u keep trying to fill it with noise but it never goes away. u feel empty and frustrated but also weirdly alive at the same time.
when u actually just sit there and do nothing for a sec, ur brain starts wandering. random thoughts come out, stuff u forgot u even thought about pops up, sometimes dumb ideas sometimes kinda good ones. it is like boredom gives ur mind the space to actually talk instead of u just drowning it all the time. it is annoying but also like a gift if u let it be.
sometimes it makes u pace around or stare at the ceiling like a weirdo and u feel stupid but that is how it works. u notice things u never do normally like the creak in the floor or shadows moving on the wall or just ur own dumb thoughts repeating. it is irritating but also kind of cool in a weird way.
boredom is also like a mirror. it shows u what u care about and what u try to ignore. u fill ur life with random stuff just to feel busy and not face ur own head. it is uncomfortable because it is honest. the second u stop and just sit there u realize u been staring at urself this whole time and u didnt even know it.
and sometimes u start liking it. like it is not empty anymore it is space. ur brain starts stretching out, thinking about dumb stuff and big stuff, random stuff u normally ignore. u come up with plans or ideas or just notice little things. it is like ur mind finally breathing. boredom is not something u need to fix it is just time letting u exist without distractions.
u hate it while u feel it but u need it imo. u realize u cant always run from urself. it is annoying, it is boring, it is frustrating, but also kinda beautiful if u dont try to escape it. it is weird how nothing can feel like everything at the same time.

<u>regret14/06/25</u>
regret is such a weird feeling it is not loud it is just there in the back of ur head like a quiet Hum sometimes u notice it in small things like chances u didnt take or moments u ignored or times u stayed silent when maybe u should have said something it is like looking back at doors that closed without u even noticing and imagining what could have been some of it is tiny and dumb like not replying to a message some of it feels bigger like missing moments that would have mattered if u had paid attention but the thing about regret is it only matters if u notice it it teaches u without punishing u if u let it it reminds u that u care that u are alive that u notice when things pass by too fast that maybe next time u can act a little faster or speak a little louder or pay a little more attention to small things that actually matter and even if u never get a second chance it is not about beating urself up it is about noticing what slips through ur fingers and maybe learning to hold on to the stuff that really counts.   affection

<u>music02/07/25</u>
music is art no matter what. music can literally change your life. it can hit u in ways nothing else does, make u feel understood, make a bad day bearable, make a good day even better. but imo u shouldnt listen to music all the time. yes, it feels good, it is calming, it gives u a place to exist for a while, but if u are always listening, it kind of loses its magic. listening to too much music just changes the way u perceive it. it lowers ur dopamine when u listen. what used to feel special and moving becomes background noise. silence starts to feel uncomfortable. i think part of the reason music is powerful is because it is not constant. it hits u when u are ready, when u arent numbing urself. too much of it and u stop noticing the details, the emotion, the little things that make it art. so enjoy it, but let it breathe. let ur brain miss it sometimes. that is how it really stays alive.i am saying this because i have expierenced musical satiation or say listening fatigue.it is powerful only when not abused atleast this is what I think.<p>my spotify: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/smgmv4b8tuvh2d8hv0np92db0?si=a739dd61c996429c" style="color: blue;">spotify</a></p>

<u>art02/07/25</u>
art is everywhere and it is everything and that is the single best thing ever. it is not just paintings or sculptures, it is music, writing, even the way u make your bed or take a photo. it is how humans try to catch a feeling and show it to others. messy, imperfect, chaotic, beautiful that is what makes it art. it is not about rules or skills, it is about expression, about making something that moves someone, even in a tiny way. that is all it needs to be.that is the single best thing ever.
